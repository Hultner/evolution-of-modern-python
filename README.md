# ⠠⠵ Evolution of modern python
**The future is now, or something...**  

This year we've left Python 2 behind, which means that we all can finally look forwards. Therefore I want to focus on all the great things that have been happening in Python 3, or modern python as I and many others like to call it.

The focus won't be on features introduced 12 years ago in Python 3, but rather what's been happening the past few years, and coming in the future.

## ⠠⠵ Quick reference

Does this section make sense for this talk? Maybe I'll use snippets from PEPs.
